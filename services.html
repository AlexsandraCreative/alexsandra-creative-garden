    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t just design — I *translate essence into experience*.  
      Every color, font, photo, and flow is chosen with intention. I believe in aesthetics that speak, structure that supports, and storytelling that softly pulls your people in.  
      Whether we’re building your brand from scratch or refreshing your site, you’ll feel held, seen, and aligned through the entire process.
