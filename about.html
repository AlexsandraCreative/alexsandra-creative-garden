    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always believed in the power of beauty, story, and energy.  
      From journaling under the stars to designing soul-aligned spaces, my creativity has never just been about aesthetics — it’s about resonance.  
      After years of exploring wellness, design, branding, and strategy, I realized my gift lies in weaving all of these into one:  
      <strong>a creative experience that aligns visuals with vision, story with soul.</strong>

        <h3>Story First</h3>
        <p>I believe every brand has a soul. I use story as the thread that weaves together identity, design, and experience.</p>

      <div class="essence-card">
        <h3>Beauty as Medicine</h3>
        <p>Visuals should feel like nourishment — soft, refined, and aligned. Aesthetic is a sacred language, and I speak it fluently.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="essence-card">
        <h3>Strategy with Soul</h3>
        <p>Yes to clarity, yes to conversions — but never at the expense of your values. I blend intuitive flow with smart, spacious systems.</p>
